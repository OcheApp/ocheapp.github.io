    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="page-date">Last updated: February 9, 2025</p>

    <p>By downloading, installing, or using Oche ("the app"), you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. License</h2>
    <p>Oche grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the app for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these terms and the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <h2>2. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the app in a manner consistent with its intended purpose as a darts scoring and training tool. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the app's services or systems</li>
        <li>Use the online multiplayer features to harass, abuse, or transmit harmful content to other users</li>
        <li>Use the app for any unlawful purpose</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Oche offers optional in-app purchases, including Oche Pro and online multiplayer credits. All purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. By making a purchase, you agree to Apple's terms of sale.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oche Pro</strong> is a one-time, non-consumable purchase that unlocks premium features permanently</li>
        <li><strong>Online credits</strong> are consumable purchases used for online multiplayer sessions requiring relay or TURN server resources</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Refunds are handled by Apple in accordance with their refund policies. We do not process refunds directly.</p>

    <h2>4. Online Multiplayer</h2>
    <p>Online multiplayer features connect you directly with other players via peer-to-peer technology. You are responsible for your conduct during online sessions. We reserve the right to limit or revoke access to online features for users who violate these terms.</p>
    <p>Online multiplayer availability depends on network conditions and third-party services (Firebase, Twilio). We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability of online features.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, design, code, and assets in Oche are owned by the developer and protected by copyright and intellectual property laws. The app name, logo, and branding are the property of the developer.</p>

    <h2>6. User Content</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of any content you create within the app (player names, custom program configurations, etc.). This content is stored locally on your device and in your iCloud account. We do not claim any rights to your content.</p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The app is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the app will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. Use of the app is at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, arising out of or related to your use of the app.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:luisrenemontana@icloud.com">luisrenemontana@icloud.com</a>.</p>
